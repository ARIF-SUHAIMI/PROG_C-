time efficientcy 
    ^faster is better
space efficientcy
    ^memory required
    ^less space demanding is better



worst case:
    longest running time for any input size

Best-efficientcy:
    shortest running time to solve the problem

Average case:
    average running time to solve the problem


big O notation O(acc) (COMPLEXITY TIME)```
O - order
acc-class of algorithm complexity

example:
O(1) :  very efficient
        constant function  
        Exp, Finding the first element of a list

O(logxn):   problem complexity increases as the problem increase

O(n)    : complexity increase linearly
        exp, counting element in a list

O(n^2)  : Quadratic increase
            two nested loop of size n

O(n^3) : Cubic increase
        Practical for small input size

O(2^n) : Exponential increase
        increasing number of execution time exponantionally
 O(1)<O(logxn)<O(n)<O(nlogxn)<O(n^2)<O(n^3)<O(2^n)
